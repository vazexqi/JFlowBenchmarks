h1. JFlow Benchmarks

This repository contains several open source flow-based applications written in Java that we have parallelized.

h2. Getting started with development

All of the projects have corresponding Eclipse projects that can be easily imported into Eclipse Juno (or later) for development. 

h4. Java Version

Please use Java 1.6. The version of the WALA analysis libraries that I will be using does not support the newer Java 7 bytecodes.

h4. Coding Conventions

When coding with Eclipse, please use the included code formatter (from Eclipse JDT) in the "Coding conventions" folder. For more information on using the custom code formatter, refer to this "guide":http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/preferences/java/codestyle/ref-preferences-formatter.htm.

h2. The benchmarks

h4. Lire

The LIRE (Lucene Image REtrieval) library provides a simple way to retrieve images and photos based on their color and texture characteristics. LIRE creates a Lucene index of image features for content based image retrieval (CBIR). Three of the available image features are taken from the MPEG-7 Standard: ScalableColor, ColorLayout and EdgeHistogram a fourth one, the Auto Color Correlogram has been implemented based on recent research results.

Original code from "Lire":http://sourceforge.net/projects/caliph-emir/?source=navbar.

h4. Jbzip2

jbzip2 is a Java bzip2 compression/decompression library. It can be used as a replacement for the Apache CBZip2InputStream / CBZip2OutputStream classes.

Original code from "Jbzip2":http://code.google.com/p/jbzip2/.

h4. Duke

Duke is a fast and flexible deduplication (or entity resolution, or record linkage) engine written in Java on top of Lucene.
